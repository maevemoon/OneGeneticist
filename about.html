                <p>I am a currently studying a BSc (Honours) in Genetics at University College Dublin. I will graduate in 2025.</p>

                <p>I programmed a little bit as a curious 12 year old, mainly to try to make silly plugins for my favourite video game at the time, Minecraft. 
                    But I was always one to move around hobbies quickly, and so it was an activity I picked up very irregularly, kind of like an old show you 
                    enjoy but watch once every few months at best.
                    <br><br>
                    Back in university, I picked up the hobby again, for longer this time. I finished a short, online course titled "Bioinformatics for Beginners" 
                    by UC San Diego, and that introduced me to a whole new world of coding. Since then, I have attempted bioinformatics-related challenges such as 
                    ROSALIND's Bioinformatics Stronghold, tried to build my own website (this one!), and also did some undergraduate research in bioinformatics!</p>
